# Project Overview
AtliQ Grand, a renowned luxury hotel chain, has been struggling with revenue and market share due to increased competition and ineffective management decisions. The objective of this project was to leverage data analytics to regain market share and boost revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

This Power BI project creates interactive dashboards for Atliq, analyzing key hotel metrics such as revenue, occupancy, and ADR (Average Daily Rate). It provides insights into weekly performance trends, room utilization, and customer satisfaction, helping optimize hotel operations and support data-driven decision-making.

Key metrics for a five-star hotel chain are calculated and visualized using Power BI, with extensive use of DAX and Power Query. This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of Atliq Grands' performance within the hospitality industry. It covers everything from importing and validating data to crafting custom measures with DAX, ultimately offering actionable insights for revenue optimization and enhancing guest satisfaction.

This is a data analysis project focused on both modeling and visualization in Power BI. In this project, I developed a dashboard that delivers revenue insights within the hospitality industry, specifically for the Atliq hotel chain.

# Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
